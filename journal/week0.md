# Week 0 â€” Billing and Architecture

Hey guys - not sure if this is where the homework is meant to go....but here it is.

This week was about getting used to the bootcap systems, apps and processes.  I've managed to watch all the videos on YouTube and have completed the tasks from the studen portal.

I've also created accounts in all the services we will be using, so I shoud be good to go for the following weeks.

I have created my diagram in Lucid too - this is the link:  https://lucid.app/lucidchart/06e2ee88-826d-4a83-8ae4-f6a299ec4874/edit?viewport_loc=-459%2C16%2C2368%2C1172%2C0_0&invitationId=inv_d980fc78-f533-4ab6-9fb9-a476e8e6fd2d

I tackled the CLI stuff but may have messed something up.....I'll have another bash at it tomorrow.

I'll also leave the domain standup to another week - I'll fly through that fairly easily.
